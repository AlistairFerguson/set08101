    <h1>David Rose</h1>
    <img src="../Style_Files/Images/david_rose.jpg">
    <p>Introduced as the adult son of Johnny and Moira Rose, David is a former New York City gallerist who curated many avant-garde exhibitions and performance art pieces, but with little direction and a sheltered worldview. The tight quarters of their new home, the Schitt's Creek Motel, create friction and opportunities for David and his disconnected family as they slowly grow closer. He becomes best friends with Stevie Budd, the motel clerk who shares his dry sense of humour and a general distaste for other people, but generally struggles to connect with others in his new surroundings. David eventually takes a job as a brand manager at a nearby clothing store before opening his own local goods business, Rose Apothecary.</p>
    <p>While launching Rose Apothecary, David meets and begins dating his business partner, Patrick Brewer. Despite having a rich dating history before moving to Schitt's Creek, David's courtship with Patrick quickly becomes the longest relationship he has ever had. Their relationship hits a brief rough patch when Patrick's previously unknown fiancée comes to town, but David and Patrick eventually reconcile. The couple continues to grow personally and professionally and they get engaged.</p>
    <p>During their engagement, David is initially very excited to move to New York City with Patrick until he learns that his fiancé has had his eye on their dream house — a cottage similar to Kate Winslet's cozy residence in The Holiday. Further straining David's move, Stevie informs him that his New York City friends chose a music festival over his wedding. David soon announces that he'll forego his move to New York City, opting to stay in Schitt's Creek with Patrick and continuing to work with him at Rose Apothecary instead. He also tells Patrick that he put in an offer on the cottage.</p>
    <p>On their wedding day, David and Patrick wake up to a storm outside and scramble to salvage their wedding — as they didn't arrange a tent for the outdoor venue. While David stresses about the wedding, Patrick arranges for him to get a massage to calm down while he figures out a new venue. After changing the location to the town hall, the couple exchanges vows in an emotional ceremony officiated by Moira, who dons a dramatic pope-inspired ensemble. The morning after the wedding, David waves his parents goodbye from the Rosebud Motel driveway with Patrick, Alexis, and Stevie by his side — ready to start a new chapter of his life in Schitt's Creek.</p>
