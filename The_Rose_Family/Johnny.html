    <h1>Johnny Rose</h1>
    <img src="../Style_Files/Images/johnny_rose.jpg">
    <p>Johnny Rose is the formerly wealthy CEO of North America's second largest video chain, Rose Video. He and his ex-daytime soap star wife, Moira, share two adult children, David and Alexis.</p>
    <p>He religiously identifies as Jewish, making minor references to his faith, such as the fact that he attended Hebrew school. Outside of these references, little is said about Johnny's upbringing, besides having worked at a button factory as a child. Sometime after his schooling, Johnny invested his entire savings, $2,000, into a video rental business he would call Rose Video, a venture that would eventually expanded to become one of the largest and most successful video rental store companies, leaving Johnny with a sizeable fortune. Sometime during this period, Johnny would also meet his future wife, Moira, at a Rose Video store opening; the two would eventually get married around 1982.</p>
    <p>After decades at the helm, Johnny's time as CEO of Rose Video came to an abrupt end when he was informed that his business manager, Eli, had been embezzling money from the company for years instead of paying their taxes, leaving the government with no choice but to repossess all of his assets—save for the town of Schitt's Creek, which Johnny jokingly bought in 1991 as a birthday present for David.</p>
    <p>As the head of the Rose family, Johnny projects a sense of leadership as he tries to take charge of a bad situation. Johnny's years as a high-powered CEO have left him largely disconnected from his adult children, yet he maintains a palpable sense of love for his family. He is particularly dedicated to his wife, Moira, whom he patiently supports at every turn, be it a successful debut as a theater director or a meltdown over anonymous trolls on the Internet. Johnny is slightly less patient, albeit still overprotective, with his children, whose lack of urgency and life skills require Johnny to be both a motivator and a reality check, including when he tells David he'll need to get a job to pay for his Parisian moisturiser. This changes as the series progresses, when their personal and professional successes turn Johnny into an enthusiastic "cheerleader" for his children.</p>
    <p>Johnny's connections with the townspeople of Schitt's Creek are more complicated. His relationship with the mayor, Roland Schitt, is initially contentious, with the mayor even removing the Rose family's motel room doors in retaliation after a minor spat with Johnny. But as the series progresses, the two continually offer each other assistance and ultimately become unlikely co-workers when Roland takes a side job at the motel. This is also true of his relationship with Stevie, which starts off with him referring to her as the "mouthy kid" manning the motel reception desk. As the Rose family's stay at the motel is extended, their interactions evolve from respectful to appreciative, to the point that Johnny becomes Stevie's business partner. From there, their relationship deepens into genuine caring. By season 5, Johnny feels right at home at the helm of the Rosebud Motel with Stevie. And as the motel receives increasing recognition and acclaim, Johnny is starting to feel like his old self: filled with purpose and pride. Johnny continues to cherish and support his loved ones in every way, even if it means taking out a line of credit to enable Moira’s spending habits. Of course, Johnny still has his sights set on leaving Schitt’s Creek, but he’s in no rush; as a man of principles, he’s willing to put in the time to build back his business and name. In season six, Johnny, using his strong business acumen, leads Roland and Stevie on their mission to land an investor for the Rosebud Motel. After pitching the idea to his former assistant's hedge fund in New York City, Johnny' finds out that his idea has been turned down. However, an alternative investor expresses interest in the franchise and ultimately supplies funding for the group.</p>
    <p>Originally planning to have the group's headquarters in New York City, Johnny ultimately decides to move the office to Los Angeles, California to be with his wife Moira.</p>
