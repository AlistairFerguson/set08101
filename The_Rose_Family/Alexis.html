    <h1>Alexis Rose</h1>
    <img src="../Style_Files/Images/alexis_rose.jpg">
    <p>Alexis is the daughter of the once wealthy Johnny and Moira Rose. Alexis has one older brother, a former gallerist and current business owner named David. Prior to moving to Schitt's Creek, Alexis spent much of her time away from her family in exotic locations around the globe as a model and socialite. These escapades were often as dangerous as they were preposterous, such as the time she was “taken hostage on David Geffen's yacht by Somali pirates for a week", or the time she was trapped in a Saudi prince's palace. But with her ingenuity (and the occasional help from David), Alexis always found her way to safety. All of this extra curricular activity subsequently left her little time to complete her high school and college education, a gap she later fills while in Schitt's Creek.</p>
    <p>Alexis’ time abroad has provided her with much life experience, but little in the way of family relationships. She is notably distant from her mother, Moira, and bickers with her older brother David over trivial matters, such as who gets the bed furthest away from the door in the motel room. Alexis nevertheless relies on her brother for support and is quick to offer encouragement and advice as David navigates love and life in Schitt's Creek. In this sense, she often mirrors her father, Johnny, who tries to keep the family grounded and help them in even the smallest matters – such as Alexis’ written grammar.</p>
    <p>Despite her family issues, Alexis is quick to develop relationships with the townspeople of Schitt's Creek. Most notable are the romantic relationships she engages in with local hippie-type, Mutt Schitt, and the town veterinarian, Ted Mullens. She oscillates between the two men – even turning down two marriage proposals – before taking some time to focus on herself. She and Ted reunite, and while their relationship strengthens, Alexis is reluctant to leave her family when Ted invites her to accompany him on an extended career opportunity in the Galápagos Islands. She eventually agrees and is set to leave with Ted, but due to a scheduling mix-up, never makes it to the Galápagos. After a period of long-distance dating, the relationship ends amicably when Alexis decides their respective careers are taking them in opposite directions.</p>
    <p>After Alexis faces bouts of heartbreak due to her split from Ted, she channels her energy into acting as her mother’s publicist during the press tour for Moira’s new film, The Crows Have Eyes III: The Crowening, doing such an impressive job that she catches the attention of Interflix, the streaming service behind the film. She accepts a job as a publicist for the company in New York City, unwavering in her decision even after her brother and Patrick decide to stay behind in Schitt's Creek. She also decides to go it alone and turns down money from Twyla, asking instead for Twyla to use it to visit her in New York.</p>
    <p>Before the Rose family members part ways, Alexis tells her mother that she's grateful they lost their fortune, explaining that it allowed her to truly get to know her family during their years at Rosebud Motel. Alexis is also the one to walk David down the aisle at his wedding. She does so wearing a white gown, which she only realizes looks like a wedding dress seconds beforehand. When she confesses that she felt she was ruining his wedding, David tells her, "I think you're giving yourself a lot of credit. My wedding was already ruined. But for what it's worth, I am continuously impressed by you."</p>
