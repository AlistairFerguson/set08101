    <p>Bob's Garage is an auto-shop located in Schitt's Creek where mechanic Bob Currie will fix or sell any broken down vehicle, for a hefty price. Established in 1943.</p>
    <p>Space in front of the garage was offered as parking space for Patrick and David's wedding, on the requirement that a space be left for Qwen, if she decided to return to Bob.</p>
    <p>Since Bobâ€™s Garage was established in 1943, and current owner Bob Currie is presumed to be born in the 1950s, it is possible he inherited the business from family; most likely from his father.</p>
