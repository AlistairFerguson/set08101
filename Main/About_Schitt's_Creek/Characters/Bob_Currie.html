    <p>Bob torments Johnny almost as much as Roland does. However, whenever Johnny needs help, Bob loves nothing more than to help him out as much as he can with a great big smile on his face; even if his help always ends up frustrating Johnny's plans. There's nothing Bob enjoys more than sharing a magazine, or the latest Rose misadventure, with his handsome wife, Gwen, whom Bob initially believes he's happily married to. And while they are indeed a united front early on, they have an acrimonious separation when Gwen leaves him for their minister and eventually takes Bob’s home too, promptly kicking him out.</p>
    <p>Bob attempts to navigate single life following his split with Gwen and stays with Roland and Jocelyn. He also gets taken out by Johnny, Roland, and Ronnie to meet women; He doesn't, however, find much luck. On David's wedding day, Bob offers his garage for parking — on the condition that a space remain clear "in case Gwen comes back;" Even with Bob being clearly separated from his wife, he still holds out hope that Gwen will return to him.</p>
