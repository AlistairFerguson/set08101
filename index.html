    <p>Schitt's Creek is a Canadian television sitcom created by Dan Levy and his father, Eugene Levy, that aired on CBC Television from 2015 to 2020. </p>
    <p>The show follows the wealthy Rose family, who lose their fortune after being defrauded by their business manager. They move towards rebuilding their lives with their sole remaining asset: a remote town named Schitt's Creek somewhere in Canada, which Johnny bought for David's birthday in 1991 as a joke. The Roses are forced to relocate to Schitt's Creek, moving into two adjacent rooms in a run-down motel. While the family adjusts to their new lives, their well-to-do attitudes conflict with the town's more provincial residents</p>
    <p>Exploring this website will reveal to you information about the titular town and its old and new residents, aswell as finding out which character you are most like!</p>
