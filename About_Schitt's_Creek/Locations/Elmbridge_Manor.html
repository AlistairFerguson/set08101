    <p>Elmbridge Manor is a large, up-scale and high priced wedding venue sought out by David Rose and Patrick Brewer during their engagement.</p>
    <p>Managed by Clive, Elmbridge Manor is set up into three pricing packages, gold, silver, and bronze; they can accommodate almost any request, however they don't give discounted prices and don't provide pricing in advance. They do, however, offer a much reduced rate on the first Sunday of every month, as that's when a local farm down the road process their pork. This farm also provides catering for Elmbridge Manor; they have fresh cheeses, breads, and meats.</p>
