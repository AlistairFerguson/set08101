    <h1>Ted Mullens</h1>
    <img src="../../Style_Files/Images/ted_mullens.jpg">
    <p>As a vet, he's the closest thing Schitt's Creek has to a doctor, since the nearest hospital is in Elmdale. Ted and Alexis start dating, but he ends up as the broken-hearted runner-up as Alexis chooses Roland and Jocelyn's son Mutt. This is subverted, however, when Alexis and Mutt's romance burns out and she realizes she made a mistake with Ted.</p>
    <p>Ted attempts to move on from Alexis by dating local farmer Heather Warner but struggles with his ongoing feeling for Alexis. Eventually, Alexis declares her love for him but wishes him happiness in his new relationship. Ted tells David he's broken up with Heather, and David encourages him to give Alexis another chance because she has changed. Ted then shows up at the Singles Week event Alexis has organized and declares his love for her in front of the crowd.</p>
    <p>Ted commits to his relationship with Alexis, even as she remains somewhat insecure about their past and the hurt she caused him. When Ted gets a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity to be a prestigious research fellowship in The Galapagos Islands he's willing to give it up to be with Alexis but she realizes its time for her to make some sacrifices for him; and although reluctant to leave her family to accompany him, she eventually agrees and the two are set to leave, but due to a scheduling mix-up, Alexis never makes it to the Islands and Ted ends up going alone.</p>
    <p>He commits to a long-distance relationship with Alexis after advising her against joining him. He later surprises her in Schitt's Creek for a long weekend, which was cut short by a bout of food poisoning on the airplane, leaving them just one day together. Ted reveals that he's been offered a full-time job, telling Alexis that the project offered him a three-year contract. After discussing their futures, they decide to amicably end their relationship â€” Alexis refusing to be the reason he turns down his dream job, and Ted adamant that Alexis chases her own career.</p>
