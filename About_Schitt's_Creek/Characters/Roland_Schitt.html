    <h1>Roland Schitt</h1>
    <img src="../../Style_Files/Images/roland_schitt.jpg">
    <p>In addition to being town’s mayor, Roland considers himself the Law in Schitt's Creek, and though he's willing to bend a few rules for the Rose family, he still loves to remind them not to bite the hand that feeds them. Roland is highly attuned to the nuances of local politics, although he’ll rarely lift a finger to institute any actual change. He’s blunt, forthright, and will always tell you what’s on his mind, even if it didn't need to be heard.</p>
    <p>Roland has gradually learned to put family first, and with a newborn baby, he wants to be more hands-on this time around. In fact, being a father appears to be the first job he really takes seriously. He is always willing to go above-and-beyond for his family, so long as he gets to play video games and watch his Julia Roberts rom-coms.</p>
