    <h1>Jocelyn Schitt</h1>
    <img src="../../Style_Files/Images/jocelyn_schitt.jpg">
    <p>As the history teacher at the Schitt's Creek High School, she struggles at times to earn the respect of her students, but she takes pleasure in being the object of sexual fantasy for a number of boys in her classroom. Jocelyn is so popular that “The Jocelyn” is a hairstyle available at Jeanine's Salon. She is also an integral member of the local all-female a Capella group, the Jazzagals.</p>
    <p>More often than not, if Jocelyn attempts to live a little less restrained or try to manipulate things into her favor, it backfires on her; She manages to trick Moira into taking on the responsibility of directing Cabaret, only for Moira to make her assistant director, which takes up even more of Jocelyn's time and energy, but Jocelyn wants only to please everyone, even at the expense of her own sanity.</p>
