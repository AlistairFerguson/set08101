    <h1>Twyla Sands</h1>

    <p>She is always ready to lend a sympathetic ear to the Rose family, even if there are other customers waiting for service and that the Roses' problems might seem petty compared to, say, having a father in prison. Twyla is particularly proud of her signature food creations. Twyla reads tarot cards to raise money for the cafe's dishwasher, and she spooks Alexis by predicting a gruesome drowning; it turns out she predicted that for a lot of people, but when it comes to the Rose family, Twyla predicts prosperity and happiness.</p>
    <p>It is later revealed that at around the arrival of the Roses, Twyla had won $92 million in the lottery, splitting the fortune in half with another person, leaving her with 46 million. She tells Alexis that she kept it a secret to the town because she doesn’t want people to treat her differently, not wanting it to change her life. Alexis urges her to splurge on something that will bring her joy, but despite the fact that Twyla "could be anywhere doing anything," she's decided that she already has everything she needs: managing the café and listening to everyone's stories. However, Twyla does purchase Café Tropical, buying the entire restaurant, informing Alexis that she wants to change its name to "Twyla's Café Tropical."</p>
    <p>Before Alexis leaves Schitt's Creek, Twyla tries giving her a check for the clothes Alexis passed on to her, adding that she can use the money to get her footing in New York City. Alexis is astounded by her friend's generosity and tempted to accept. However, she refuses and decides to make it on her own, telling Twyla that she's the best person she's ever known, and to use that money to visit her when she can.</p>
