    <h1>Patrick Brewer</h1>

    <p>Patrick first appears when David is establishing his new apothecary. A professional assisting with business licensing, he shows interest in David's business. Alexis suggests to David that Patrick's interest is in more than just the business. Patrick is then a topic of discussion between Stevie and David; concerning his sexuality, and whether or not he has feelings for David. These suspicions prove to be true when David kisses Patrick, and Patrick reveals how glad he was for that kiss to have happened.</p>
    <p>As David's newly minted boyfriend, Patrick tries his best to navigate through this relationship which needs much love and attention. As Patrick becomes comfortable with his sexuality and blossoming feelings for David, his romantic gestures are met with a mixed reaction from the ever-insecure David.</p>
    <p>Patrick settles into Schitt's Creek, becoming a member of the community beyond just as David's boyfriend and business partner. He gets his own apartment and throws a Housewarming party. He also participates in an amateur baseball league, and gets a major role in Moira's community theatre production of Cabaret. David, of course, remains a priority but the two men still have some things to negotiate in their relationship, especially as David decides it's time to meet the parents. Fortunately, they are loving and accepting, even as Patrick finds it hard to tell them for fear it will change how they see him. Some time after this, Patrick takes a reluctant and whiney David on a hike to a beautiful view, and Patrick tells David he used to come there often when they first met to contemplate his growing feelings for David. He then gets on one knee and proposes, which David accepts. The two later marry in less than ideal circumstances, with the weather impacting most of their plans.</p>
