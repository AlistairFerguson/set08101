    <p>Stevie would prefer to spend her days goofing off with David instead of doing any real work, but after the death of her great-aunt Maureen drops some major new responsibilities into her lap, Stevie must decide if she’s really ready to grow up and take charge of the family business: the Schitt's Creek Motel. With the apparent success of the motel and the new responsibilities thrust upon her, Stevie steps up and shows her drive and dedication. Stevie’s not accustomed to the quick changes that come with improving the motel, like developing marketing and publicity strategies, or even a functioning website. But with Johnny as a reassuring business partner, she feels supported and determined, and is slowly becoming part of the Rose family.</p>
    <p>Stevie soon starts questioning her own future for the first time. She reluctantly decides to push her personal boundaries, but quickly sees why leaving your comfort zone is difficult. When Moira surprises Stevie by presenting the opportunity to work together on Cabaret, Stevie does the most un-Stevie thing, and says yes. After a time of questioning her life decisions and career path, she ultimately decides to keep working with Johnny and Roland to build the Rosebud Motel Group. Her future role within the group requires her to have a home base in Schitt's Creek while traveling around the country to open new Rosebud Motel locations. After David asks her why she's staying in Schitt's Creek after talking about living and working elsewhere, Stevie explains that she didn't want to move to a big city like New York, she just wanted to know that she could.</p>
