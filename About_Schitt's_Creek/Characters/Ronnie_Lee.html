    <h1>Ronnie Lee</h1>
    <img src="../../Style_Files/Images/ronnie_lee.jpg">
    <p>Ronnie oversees Alexis Rose‘a involvement in community service, though in general she feels that Alexis, and the whole Rose family, to be more of a disservice to the community of Schitt’s Creek. Ronnie almost always snarks on the Rose family, and she's usually in the right. Her sassiness is usually expressed in glares and eye rolls, but she always makes it clear that she has no time for any of the Roses' shenanigans nor problems.</p>
    <p>Ronnie later becomes an arch-nemesis to Patrick; he mishandles a complaint about her renovations to the Rose Apothecary bathroom, and she also develops a rivalry with Patrick over baseball. Their relationship never does recover, as she will do nothing in favor to him, that is unless his partner, David, whom she is fond of, is involved.</p>
    <p>When Moira tells the Jazzagals that she's leaving Schitt's Creek to pursue her acting career, Ronnie tears up and catches the group by surprise. Revealing how much she cares about Moira, Ronnie shows a rare glimpse of emotion and joins a group hug around her. Ronnie also helps in to pitch with David's wedding, managing to get all new flowers to decorate the venue due to her knowing the florist intimately, although she makes it clear she's doing it for David, not Patrick, whom she is still mad at.</p>
